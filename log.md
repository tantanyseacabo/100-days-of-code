# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Setting up Git, VS Code, and other tools

**Thoughts:** I had been installing a bunch of things previously and my stack was all over the place, so it took me some time to put my software and credentials in order.

**Link to work:** N/A

## Day 1: May 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Survey from FreeCodeCamp projects

**Thoughts:** I was sick so it took me a week to start this challenge after setting everything up. I had previously started with the Survey Form but today I finished the HTML and created the CSS. I consider myself creative but still have a hard time visualizing and creating a nice UI from scratch, I'm guessing it's just a matter of research until my brain soaks up this knowledge

## Day 2: May 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished FCC Landing page's HTML skeleton and got a good advance with the styling

**Thoughts:** I hadn't used much CSS for a few months so I had troubles starting, but as soon as I warmed up everything went smooth. I could've finished this if I had more time

## Day 3: May 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Landing Page homework

**Thoughts:** Today I decided I would do everything I can to save this school semester, so spent all night catching up with the Web Design homework. I really like the end product of this!

I might take a few days off this challenge in order to finish the non-coding activities, but I'll do my best to stick to it

## Day 4: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Embedded the YouTube video to the FCC Product Page and made the header sticky

**Thoughts:** I was able to finish most of a semester's worth of work in a week, and I'm back to the 100 days of code challenge. Today I was tired and took me a while to recognize where I was and what was I trying to do on this project. I also worked less than 1 hour, so I wasn't able to do much. However, I have refreshed ideas and am ready to finish this page tomorrow.
